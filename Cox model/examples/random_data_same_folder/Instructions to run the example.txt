There are many ways to run R code. The proposed instructions here are focusing on using a graphical interface

:::::: INSTALLING R and R STUDIO ::::::
1)	Go to the page : https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ and follow the instructions for your operating system

:::::: INSTALLING THE REQUIRED PACKAGES ::::::
: The examples require the use a package not present in the base installation :
- survival : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/survival.pdf
- survminer : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/index.html https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/survminer.pdf
- MASS : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/MASS.pdf

: The examples will be easier to explore and adapt/change if the package "this.path" is also available.
- this.path : https://cran.r-project.org/package=this.path https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/this.path/this.path.pdf
- Yet this is NOT required and you can safely ignore any warning about this is if you want to use the examples "as-is".

: R should prompt you to download the packages automatically

1)	If you work in an isolated environment, you might need to download them manually at the adress above and install them for your RStudio instance
: While describing the process here is out of scope, a web search will yield resources like https://riptutorial.com/r/example/5556/install-package-from-local-source that can be helpful.

:::::: INSTALLING THE EXAMPLE ::::::
1)	Unpack one of the example folders on one of your drives

:::::: EXECUTING THE DISTRIBUTED CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
*** If you are not able to automatically set your working directory, manually set the variable manualwd = 1 in Local_site_call.R and Global_server.R
1) 	Run the local r file (Local_site_call.R) for each data node to compute local times and local beta estimates
2)	Run the coordination r file (Global_server.R) to compute global times and to initialise the values of beta

Then, to perform an iteration:
3) 	Run the local r file (Local_site_call.R) for each data node to compute local parameters (first iteration only) and to compute local aggregates used for derivatives
4)	Run the coordination r file (Global_server.R) to compute global parameters (first iteration only) and to compute first and second derivative and to update beta estimate
5)	optional : compare the results of the previous iteration with the current one to decide if another iteration is pertinent (return to step 3) or not		

:::::: EXECUTING THE POOLED SOLUTION CODE ::::::
*** Make sure R studio is not currently running and close it if it is.
1)	Navigate to the folder "pooled_comparator"
2)	Open the file "Solution.R". It should then appear in R.
3)	Select all the code and click "run"
4)	The results will be available in the console
