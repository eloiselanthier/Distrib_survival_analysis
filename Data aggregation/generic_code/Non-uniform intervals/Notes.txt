1. Non-uniform intervals - Local
: Generate matrix locally

2. Non-uniform intervals - Global
: Determine intervals

3. Non-uniform intervals - Local
: Split data according to partition

*** Before executing the code, make sure the parameters in "Parameters.csv" are set to the right value (see next section).

:::::: PARAMETERS TO AJUST ::::::

The parameters should be determined by the central server and must not be modified by the local sites. The key parameters are as follows:

- nbDataGrouped : This is the number of subjects that will be grouped together. The recommended value is 5.
- lower_bound : This is the lowest value possible across all datasets. The default value is 0.
- upper_bound : This is the highest value possible across all datasets or the length of the study. It is preferable to overestimate this value to ensure coverage.
