The three folders contain different methods to categorize individuals into time intervals differently.

Average orders the data by time and averages the time values across a specified number of individuals.

Uniform intervals divide the study's time span into equal segments.

Non-uniform intervals divide time into the shortest intervals possible, each containing at least x individuals.
